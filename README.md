## 🛠️ What I Do

I build end-to-end AI systems that bridge real-world data and intelligent decision-making — blending models, infra, and thoughtful design to solve meaningful problems.

**Things I enjoy and work on:**
- ⚡ Crafting efficient **LLM pipelines** using techniques like **RAG**, **PEFT**, **LoRA**, and **quantization**.
- 🧠 Building **intelligent agents** that orchestrate tools, memory, and context using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and custom rule based logics.
- 🎥 Developing **real-time video analytics** using models like **YOLO, DINO, ViT**, and some other models, with **Kafka** and **WebRTC**.
- 📦 Deploying AI at the **edge** — think Jetson, Raspberry Pi, or Hailo chips — with offline fallback and robust analytics.
- 🔁 Automating **model retraining** with version-controlled datasets, feedback loops, and smooth deployment.
- 🛠️ Designing systems that are modular, scalable, and developer-friendly — because clean architecture matters.
