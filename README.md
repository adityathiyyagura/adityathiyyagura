## 🛠️ What I Do

I’m a Machine Learning Engineer with ~2 years of experience crafting **end-to-end AI systems** — from **LLM pipelines** and **multimodal agents** to **edge-deployed video analytics**.  
Currently at **eizen.ai**, I architect scalable, production-grade systems that turn real-time sensor data and human intent into decisive action.

**Highlights:**
- 🧩 Built modular LLM pipelines with **RAG**, **PEFT**, **LoRA**, achieving 40% latency/cost reduction.
- 🤖 Designed intelligent agents using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and rule engines for real-time orchestration.
- 🎥 Built real-time analytics with **YOLO, DINO, ViT, TimesFormer** on **Kafka + WebRTC**.
- 📦 Deployed edge systems on **Jetson, Raspberry Pi, Hailo** with offline fallback.
- 🔁 Automated retraining with CI/CD pipelines, cutting manual tuning by 60%.
